**Neuro-Marketing Analytics and Predictive Modeling**
**Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing EEG data to extract neuro-marketing metrics and predict consumer preferences. The analysis pipeline includes EEG data preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning-based predictive modeling. The project also involves statistical analysis of brain signals to extract meaningful information, aiding in the understanding of consumer responses to various advertisements.

**Key Features**
**EEG Data Processing:**

Applied filtering techniques, including bandpass and notch filters, to clean the raw EEG data.
Segmented the EEG data into epochs for focused analysis.
Feature Extraction:

Performed wavelet decomposition to identify key EEG frequency bands, including Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma.
Extracted neuro-marketing metrics such as arousal, brain perfusion, cognitive performance, and vigilance indices.
Statistical Analysis:

Utilized SPSS for in-depth analysis of brain signals to gain insights into the underlying EEG data.
Machine Learning Pipeline:

Implemented ANOVA feature selection to identify the most significant features.
Used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) for oversampling to address class imbalance.
Conducted hyperparameter tuning using random search and grid search methods.
Evaluated ensemble and XGBoost models for predictive accuracy.
Generated performance metrics including training/testing accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curves.
